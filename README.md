# RNA-seq-Analysis-of-Surface-vs-Cavefish-Brains
This repository contains a full RNA-seq analysis workflow comparing gene expression between surface and cavefish (Astyanax mexicanus) brains across age groups (young vs old). The analysis aims to uncover molecular mechanisms linked to biological resilience and neurodegeneration resistance in cavefish.
